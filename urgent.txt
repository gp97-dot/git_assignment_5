Severity: CRITICAL
Branch: hotfix/urgent
Date: December 9, 2025

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
-----------------
Critical authentication vulnerability discovered in production environment.
Users were experiencing intermittent logout issues causing session data loss
and preventing access to dashboard features.

IMPACT
------
- Affected: 15% of active users
- Duration: Detected 2 hours ago
- Severity: HIGH - User experience significantly impacted
- Business Impact: Users unable to access core dashboard functionality

ROOT CAUSE
----------
Session timeout configuration was incorrectly set during the v1.0 release,
causing premature session expiration. The navigation component was not
properly handling session refresh tokens.

RESOLUTION
----------
1. Fixed session timeout configuration (extended from 5min to 30min)
2. Updated navigation component to handle session refresh properly
3. Added session persistence validation
4. Implemented proper error handling for authentication failures

- Modified: authentication/session.config
- Updated: navigation/auth-handler.js
- Added: session validation middleware
- Patched: token refresh mechanism

TESTING PERFORMED

- Unit tests: PASSED
- Integration tests: PASSED
- Manual testing in staging: PASSED
- User session persistence verified
